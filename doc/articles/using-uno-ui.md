# Developing with Uno Platform

Write applications once in XAML and C# and deploy them to [any target platform](getting-started/requirements.md).

## About Uno

 * [What is Uno Platform?](what-is-uno.md)
 * [How does Uno Platform work?](how-uno-works.md)
 * [Supported target platforms](getting-started/requirements.md)
 * [Supported .NET versions by platform](net-version-support.md)

## Mastering the basics

The WinUI application API which Uno Platform uses is extensively documented by Microsoft. We've [selected some articles from Microsoft](winui-doc-links.md) which will jump-start your Uno Platform development.

Here are some articles which cover the basics of cross-platform Uno development:

 * [The structure of an Uno Platform codebase](uno-app-solution-structure.md)
 * Platform-specific code: [C#](platform-specific-csharp.md) and [XAML](platform-specific-xaml.md)
 * [Best practices for developing Uno Platform applications](best-practices-uno.md)

## WinUI features

These articles cover general WinUI features in Uno Platform, discussing what's supported and which platform-specific constraints exist.

 * [Accessibility](features/working-with-accessibility.md)
 * [Assets in shared code](features/working-with-assets.md)
 * [Custom fonts](features/custom-fonts.md)
 * [Shapes & Brushes](features/shapes-and-brushes.md)
 * [Handling user input](features/pointers-keyboard-and-other-user-inputs.md)
 * [Using WinUI 2 controls](features/using-winui2.md)

## WinUI controls

Uno Platform provides support for a large number of WinUI controls, panels, and visual primitives - see [a complete list](implemented-views.md) in the Reference documentation. The 'WinUI controls' section in the Table of Contents on the left covers platform-specific constraints and extensions for selected controls. 

## WinRT features (non-visual APIs)

Uno Platform supports a number of non-visual APIs from Windows Runtime namespaces on non-Windows platforms, like [clipboard management](features/windows-applicationmodel-datatransfer.md) and [sensor access](features/windows-devices-sensors.md). Browse the complete list under 'WinRT features' on the left, and check individual entries for platform-specific information.

## Features unique to Uno

 * [VisibleBoundsPadding - manage 'safe' area on notched devices](features/VisibleBoundsPadding.md)
 * [ElevatedView - apply a shadow effect on all platforms](features/ElevatedView.md)
 * [Uno.Material - Material Design on all platforms](features/uno-material.md)

## Core functionality

 * [Enable and configure logging](logging.md)
 * [Configure build telemetry](uno-toolchain-telemetry.md)
 * [Add native views to the visual tree](native-views.md)
 * [Enable native control styles (Android and iOS)](native-styles.md)
