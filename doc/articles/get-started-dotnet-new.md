dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp
```

A more advanced example which will not generate the android and macOS heads:

dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp -android=false -macos=false
```

dotnet new unoapp-winui -o MyApp
```

## Uno Platform Blank library

This template can be used to create a blank library. With this type of library, Skia and WebAssembly do not need to built separately, but cannot be differentiated.

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unolib -o MyUnoLib
```

## Uno Platform Blank Cross-Runtime library

This template can be used to create a blank cross-runtime library, when platform specific code needs to be created for Skia and WebAssembly.

```
dotnet new unolib-crossruntime -o MyCrossRuntimeLibrary
```

## Uno Platform Blank Prism Application

This template is specializing in the creation of a [Prism Library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) enabled blank application.

```
dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp -android=false -macos=false
```

## Uno Platform Uno.UITest library
This templates creates a project for creating and running UI Tests based on [Uno.UITest](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.UITest).

1. Create a Xamarin.Forms project 
    1. Check **Place project and solution in the same directory**
    1. Check **Windows (UWP)**
1. Using a **VS Developer Command Prompt**, navigate to the folder containing the solution
    ```
    dotnet new wasmxfhead
    ```
1. Open or Reload the solution in Visual Studio 
1. Set the Wasm project as the startup project 
1. Open the **Nuget Package manager** for the Wasm project and update the `Uno.Xamarin.Forms.Platform` project to the latest **stable** package
