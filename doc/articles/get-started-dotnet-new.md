```

A more advanced example which will not generate the android and macOS heads:

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unolib -o MyUnoLib
```

## Uno Platform Blank Cross-Runtime library

This template can be used to create a blank cross-runtime library, when platform specific code needs to be created for Skia and WebAssembly.

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unolib-crossruntime -o MyCrossRuntimeLibrary
```

## Uno Platform Blank Prism Application

This template is specializing in the creation of a [Prism Library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) enabled blank application.

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unoapp-prism -o MyApp
```

A more advanced example which will not generate the android and macOS heads:

```
dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp -android=false -macos=false
```

## Uno Platform Uno.UITest library
This templates creates a project for creating and running UI Tests based on [Uno.UITest](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.UITest).

Considering you've created an application as follows:
- `dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp`

To create a UI Tests library:
- Create a folder name `MyApp\MyApp.UITests`
- In that folder, run `dotnet new unoapp-uitest`

This will automatically add the new project to the existing solution.

For additional information about UI Tests creation, visit the [Uno.UITest](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.UITest) documentation.

## Uno Platform WebAssembly support for Xamarin Forms

This template is built to enhance an existing Xamarin.Forms application with the [Uno Platform WebAssembly support](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Xamarin.Forms.Platform).

To use it:

1. Create a Xamarin.Forms project 
    1. Check **Place project and solution in the same directory**
    1. Check **Windows (UWP)**
1. Using a **VS Developer Command Prompt**, navigate to the folder containing the solution
    ```
    dotnet new wasmxfhead
    ```
1. Open or Reload the solution in Visual Studio 
1. Set the Wasm project as the startup project 
1. Open the **Nuget Package manager** for the Wasm project and update the `Uno.Xamarin.Forms.Platform` project to the latest **stable** package 
1. Run the app using **Ctrl+F5** (without the Visual Studio debugger), and youï¿½re good to go!
