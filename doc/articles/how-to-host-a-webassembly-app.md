# How to host a WebAssembly App

- WASM Web Server Configuration
  - [Nginx](#nginx)
  - [Apache](#apache)


Regardless of the webserver (or reverse proxy) software used, the support the following Content (MIME) types are always needed:

-   `application/wasm`
-   `application/octet-stream`
-   `application/font-woff`

## Nginx

Below contains a performance tuned version of *nginx* fitting WebAssembly deployments. The MIME types have been extended on top of the base *nginx* MIME types with WASM support.

```nginx
user nginx;

pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

# you must set worker processes based on your CPU cores, nginx does not benefit from setting more than that
worker_processes auto; #some last versions calculate it automatically

# number of file descriptors used for nginx
# the limit for the maximum FDs on the server is usually set by the OS.
# if you don't set FD's then OS settings will be used which is by default 2000
worker_rlimit_nofile 100000;

# only log critical errors
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log crit;

  # determines how much clients will be served per worker
  # max clients = worker_connections * worker_processes
  # max clients is also limited by the number of socket connections available on the system (~64k)
  worker_connections 4000;

  # optmized to serve many clients with each thread, essential for linux -- for testing environment
  use epoll;

  # accept as many connections as possible, may flood worker connections if set too low -- for testing environment
  multi_accept on;
}

If you have *brotli* enabled via [`ngx-brotli` module](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli), you can add the following block for extra compression performance.

```nginx
brotli_static on;
brotli on;
brotli_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript application/x-javascript text/javascript;
brotli_comp_level 4;
```

## Apache

For *Apache*, please use the [`AddType` directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_mime.html#addtype) to add WASM support to the root of your apache config, likely located at either `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or `/etc/httpd.d/conf/httpd.conf`. Then, restart your *Apache* web server or *Apache* container (if you running with Docker).

```apache
AddType application/wasm .wasm
AddType application/octet-stream .clr
AddType application/octet-stream .dat
AddType application/octet-stream .pdb
AddType application/font-woff .woff
AddType application/font-woff .woff2
```
