# Migrating from Silverlight to WinUI and Uno Platform Documentation

Silverlight will reach the end of support  on October 12, 2021. As luck would have it, a new Windows UI framework is about to RTM in March 2021 – WinUI – the modern native UI platform of Windows. And with WinUI launch there is a renewed desire by C# and XAML developers to write single codebase applications for Windows and the Web.

Enter Uno Platform. Hello “Rich Internet Applications (RIA)” again!

There are a number of pages of Silverlight migration documentation to help you with migration – accompanying source code, techniques and considerations you need to make when migrating your Silverlight application.
